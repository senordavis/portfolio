One of my goals in life is to own a Delorean. I've come to terms with the fact that it may never fly and/or travel through time but one can always dream.;
I've always loved reading, although I never have time. My perfect place to read is in northern Michigan, on a dock at Walloon Lake with my feet in the water.
