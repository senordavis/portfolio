Born a doodler, there is no end to the number of stories that can be told of how as a child Mike would color on walls, paper scraps, sidewalks, or anything that was available. He can remember at a young age watching the local PBS channel and enjoying shows like “Mr. Rogers Neighborhood”, where he learned about story telling, and “Mark Kistler’s Imagination Station”, where he got his first bits of art education.

He studied art, art history, and graphic design at Michigan State University earning a B.F.A. in Studio Art with a concentration in Graphic Design. While attending MSU, he learned a great deal of what it takes to visually communicate ideas through graphics and illustration. He has worked as a professional designer for more than a decade in the Mid-Michigan area.

His experience has led him to understand that creative design and thoughtful solutions can communicate, inform, and inspire.
